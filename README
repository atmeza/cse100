Questions:

1) It is necessary that Data& d be constant because this reference must not 
change due to the BST. The const guarantees that the data stored on BSTNodes
will not changed by the BST itself.

2a) The post increment operator takes in an argument, namely an int, for the
purpose of distinguishing it from the preincrement operator, it serves no
functional value other than that.

2b) The issue with post increment as opposed to pre increment is that upon
pre incrementing, that new object will immediately be used while as post the object
must maintain its original state during use and change its state after use.
to solve this problem, a reference in the form of an iterator is returned pointing to original state of the data whereas the actual object has been incremented. In the end
this allows for the incrementation to not be used in the program until the object 
has been operated on.
